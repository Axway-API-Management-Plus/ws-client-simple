== About the Tool

The tool is a simple client for WebSocket.
It simulates multiple client endpoints and sends/received messages to/from a WebSocket server.
It can be used to test WebSocket listeners of an API Gateway.
Check Axway API Gateway documentation to https://docs.axway.com/bundle/axway-open-docs/page/docs/apim_policydev/apigw_gw_instances/general_websocket/index.html[configure WebSocket connections].

== Usage

The default behavior is to send a single text message to the `ws://localhost:8025/echo` endpoint.
This is the default endpoint of the https://github.com/Axway-API-Management-Plus/ws-server-simple[simple WebSocket server].

<1> Client connects to `ws://echo.websocket.org`
<2> The ID of the endpoint is shown in brackets.
Each simulated endpoint has its own identifier.
